This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm a student with an open mind, ready to learn new skills. I have recently had the opportunity to learn the basics of programming, which has sparked my fascination. I am currently focusing on developing my knowledge of SQL, and my next step will be to attend trainings and courses related to Python.

Whether I am learning languages or exploring programming, I always aim to continuously develop and expand my skills. Open to new challenges, I am ready to get involved in a variety of projects to keep developing my skills and contributing to inspiring initiatives. The distinct experiences and time I've spent in Ireland and France have enriched my viewpoint and deepened my comprehension of diverse cultures and individuals. I find immense joy in being part of global settings.
